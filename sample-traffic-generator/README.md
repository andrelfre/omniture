Introduction
------------

The Omniture Analytics Sample Traffic.jmx is a JMeter script to generate sample requests to Omniture Site Catalyst.

You can simulate user traffic as it was generated by actual website visitors and have your Site Catalyst report suite populated even before implementing the tracking code in the website pages.


How to Use
----------

In JMeter, you'll have to set some variables to reflect your Omniture Site Catalyst configuration:

* Omniture Analytics Sample Traffic
- suiteId
- baseUrl
- sProps, eVars and events (as per your suite setup)

* HTTP Request Defaults
- Server Name
- Port Number
- Path

* HTTP Headers (Optionally)
- User-Agent
- Accept
- Accept-Language

Then you can proceed with the test plan creation as usual. Sample test scenarios are provided.
